# Decode Ways â€” Go Example

An example solution for the **"Decode Ways"** implemented in Go.

## Problem

Given a string containing digits, count how many ways it can be decoded into letters, where:

- `'1' -> 'A'`, `'2' -> 'B'`, ..., `'26' -> 'Z'`.
- `'0'` cannot be decoded alone, only as part of `'10'` or `'20'`.

## Run

```bash
go run main.go
```
